#### Description
This was a group collaboration for our second Bootcamp project. Our goals for this project were to create and deploy a website which uses node and express.js to create a RESTful API. Handlebars.js as our template engine, with MySQL and Sequelize ORM for the database. We have included both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new user, password, and score data. In addition we were challenged  to use a new library, package, or technology we haven't discussed in class, we chose to build a basic HTML style platforming game using Phaser.js. Our project also follows the MVC paradigm which also uses authentication and session cookies.
